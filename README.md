## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML
- CSS/Variables
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
What I have learned recreating this blog card was how to make an image and text sit inline with each other, and for the first time make an active state.
I also learned on my own before Frontend mentor was Variables which you will see in my CSS code I used it for the first time so handy


```html
    <footer>
      <img src="/assets/images/image-avatar.webp" alt="" width="48">
      <p class="name">Greg Hooper</p>
    </footer>
```
```css
:root {
    --bg-color-: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
    --card-color-: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    --text-: 500;
    --title-: 800;
    --gray-500-: hsl(0, 0%, 42%);
    --gray-950-: hsl(0, 0%, 7%);
}
```
### Continued development
Area's I want to work on is keeping style clean and short. I will be focusing Media Queries as its not my strongest thing to do I will be revisiting this repo to put into practice other ways to create this card again.
